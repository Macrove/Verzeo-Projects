# Verzeo-Projects

## MINOR PROJECT

The aim of the project is to understand the differences in scores of students based on gender, race, parental level of education and lunch reservations.
The dataset was provided to me by VERZEO during their internship program and the rights to data belongs to them.

This project was also an attempt to use and understand more about data science/ Exploratory data analysis.

## MAJOR PRJECT

This project has been done in collaboration with 13 other interns. The goal was to implement various techniques like EDA and Machine Learning to understand the variation in second hand car sales based on various factors like location, age of car, condition and other qualities.

## Surprise Housing : OUTSTANDING PROJECT PHASE

The aim of this project was to understand the housing prices in a city and simultaneously build understand the differences and implementation of regularization in linear models like lasso and ridge regression.

I thank Verzeo for giving me the opportunity to learn along with great set of students.
I will keep making edits and improvements in future.
